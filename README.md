# JA3-FinalStand

## TODO
- finish rewards system (including making sure bobby ray works)
- finish faction (bonuses) and attires
- balancing
- add 3-4 maps (4-5 total)

## Ideas

- new faction PMC (Foreign mercenaries?)
- Sector operations improving the map
---- Game Started
--V-- New Game -> Final Stand
------ Choose Options for Game:
------ Waves (3-7 waves) - FIX UI and test game remembering choice
------ Enemy Faction (random, legion, army, ...) - CHANGE to be defined through editor
------ Sector - (random, ...x4-5)
------- GAME STARTED:
------- Choose Mercs - CHANGE starting money
------- Schedule Enemy Assault Squad - CHANCE to be generated by proper class from editor definitions
------- (?) Enforce Mercs wearing themed gear (maybe option)
-------- ON BATTLE WIN:
-------- Schedule Next Attack
-------- Let player rearm from store
-------- Let player do Sector operations (differs per map)
--------- ON LAST BATTLE FIN
--------- Play Good Finale
-------- ON BATTLE LOOSE:
-------- Schedule Bad Ending
