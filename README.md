# JA3-FinalStand

## IDEAS

- Give loadouts to sector inventory on game start (depending on mers and their types).
- Give a little bit of supplies on turn end (Only for Militia?).
- Add rest of Enemy Factions as Playable (Legion, Adonis, Army, Super Soldiers).
- Add support for mercs that are not part of the starting choices.
- Add Boss Enemies for each factions.
- New Faction PMC (Foreign Mercenaries?).
- Sector Operations improving the Map (Reinforcements, Machine Guns).
- Rework Start and Ending (Cutscenes? Better Credits?)
- Add voice responses to start/surviving waves (different announcer for each faction?)
- Each Player Faction has a slightly different UI (only color/some icons?)
