__Final Stand__ is a new campaign designed as a replayable survival gamemode. 
Every playthrough offers a unique experience through the decisions you make, the strategies you employ, and the tactics you use to survive.

Choose your faction, an enemy faction, and a sector to defend.
Assemble a squad of mercs and take your stance, fighting waves of enemies.
Beating a wave will grant you XP, money, and some respite.
Spend it wisely and prepare for the next wave, level up mercs, buy guns, gather supplies, and perform sector operations.
Each wave will be tougher with better-equipped enemies and greater numbers.
Beat them all in order to win.

Upon starting a new game from the menu, you can now select a new campaign, Final Stand. 
Selecting it will show standard pre-game configuration with new Final Stand exclusive options:
__Map__ (Sector), __Length__ (Waves), __Player Faction__ and __Enemy Faction__.

- __Map (or Sector)__ - choose a sector to take your stance in. 
From well defendable fortresses to tightly populated slums.
__Current available sectors__ are: ___Fort L'Eau Bleu (H4), Rimville (I9), Port Cacao City (L8), Pantagruel Slums (D7), Ille Morat (D17)___.
- __Length__ - choose how long you want your playthrough to be. 
Longer games will be more satisfying to beat and provide more to experience. __Highly recommended__ to play __7 waves__.
__Current available lengths__ are: __3__ Waves, __5__ Waves, __7__ Waves.
- __Player Faction__ - choose your faction. Each faction provides bonuses and penalties with the goal of altering playthrough.
On top of that, your chosen mercenaries will wear faction attire compiled from faction-themed pools. 
The exception is the __No Faction__ option, which provides vanilla experience with no bonuses or penalties and no faction-themed attire.
__Current available player factions__ are: ___No Faction___, ___Militia___, ___Rebels___.
- __Enemy Faction__ - the main opposing force, depending on your choice, the enemy faction will yield different rewards (XP, money, loyalty), and you will face different units.
__Current available enemy factions__ are: ___Legion, Adonis, Grand Chien Army, Siegfried's Guard (Super Soldiers)___.

Each player faction and enemy faction has its strengths and weaknesses. 
Some might be easier to play as or against, so if you lose, try again with a different enemy or different tactics.

In order to win, you have to beat all 7 (or other selected number) waves of enemies. 
Losing your squad(s) for the first time doesn't mean defeat, instead you will enter _Last Chance_ and will be prompted to spend all your resources for a push.
Assembling a new squad and retaking the sector will continue the campaign and exit _Last Chance_, failing to retake the sector will end the campaign.

In between waves you will have a chance to perform sector operations, hire new mercs, order new guns, or scavenge locations.
For you to order guns, ammo, or other supplies, use BobbyRay's store like in Hot Diamonds.
You start with a tier 0 store, and every wave won will increase it by 1 as well as replenish the stock, providing you with options for the next wave.
In FS BobbyRay's store, deliveries arrive faster, and sector operations take less time. 
But you will still need to plan what you can and can't do in the short period of time between waves. 
Money and time are always a leading factor.

![Roadmap](https://imgur.com/odgfxXd.png)
The roadmap represents a set of concepts and improvements that are planned to be added in later updates. 
This list is not final and will change and expand.

- __Addons Support__ - _FS_ was built with expandability in mind, but it's not currently at a place I am happy with.
This change will bring support (with a detailed guide) for expanding FS into any direction one might wish using game-provided modding tools. 
Add your own sectors, player factions with custom attire and bonuses, and enemy factions with custom units. 
All to the base _FS_ campaign OR create your own _FS_ campaign with unique previously mentioned sets, configs, and rules.
- __More Player Factions__ - This update will bring the rest of the in-game factions to the playable pool.
In particular: Legion, Adonis, Grand Chien Army, Siegfried's Guard, and Foreign Mercenaries.
- __Start and Ending Rework__ - The first step towards making FS feel like an actual campaign would be adding intro and outro videos, cutscenes, and expanded credits.
- __Sector Operations__ - The current set of operations features standard game operations like crafting and rest.
My wish is to expand player defense capabilities and strategy choices with special operations that will alter the sector.
Like adding machine gun points, traps, barricades, etc.
- __Dialog Addition__ - The second step towards making FS feel like an actual campaign is a set of dialogs that will be added to different key points and player actions.
Hopefully unique per player faction, but this is uncertain.
- __Multiplayer Support__ - This might take some time but regardless it is important to have the mod support all parts of the game and seamlessly integrate itself.
- __Rewards beyond Final Stand__ - I wish to reward players beating _FS_ campaign with and against different factions 
by providing a way to receive unique rewards (like unique-looking, named guns, for example) in Hot Diamonds campaign. 
This will hopefully bring some motivation to the table and will remind of ones achievements.

![Compatibility](https://imgur.com/I11Wukc.png)
While the mod was designed to be fully compatible with other mods, it is impossible to cover every case.
It is recommended that you play FS without any logic-heavy mods for the first time; any smaller mods, like custom mercs, should work without issues.

__MULTIPLAYER__ is not currently supported!
It is __HIGHLY RECOMMENDED__ to restart the game after mod activation or deactivation.
