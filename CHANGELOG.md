# Final Stand

# 1.00

### Detailed Changes
Initial version with no detailed changes. Present functionality and basic concepts are described in the Description section.

### Description
Upon starting a new game from the menu, player can now select a new campaign - ___Final Stand___. Clicking it will move the 
player to pre-game configuration menu. Between campaign name and default campaign options new Final Stand exclusive 
options will be appended - __Map__ (Sector), __Length__ (Waves), __Player Faction__ and __Enemy Faction__.

- __Map (or Sector)__ - base version of Final Stand includes 5 maps from the base game (Hot Diamonds) with no alterations 
(except some marker clean-up) for the player to choose and take stand in. Player can not leave selected sector, all mercs 
and enemies will arrive only to selected sector. These sectors feature standard set of operations, including crafting 
ammo/explosions, some maps that are hospitals in the base game, can be used as hospitals in FS. __Current available sectors__
are: ___List sectors here___.
- __Length__ - only defines the amount of waves. Enemies and rewards are not tied to the length but instead 
to individual wave number, meaning the game rewards and difficulty does not scale to shorter games. This might be 
something worth reworking later. __Current available lengths__ are: 3 Waves, 5 Waves, 7 Waves.
- __Player Faction__ - player can still choose mercenaries, but depending on the player chosen faction and merc 
specialisation they will wear attire. This attire is randomly generated from their assigned respective pools. On top of 
that, each faction has bonuses and penalties that alter the way the game is played. __Current available player factions__ are: _Mercs_ - no changes to 
attire and no bonuses or penalties, this is "vanilla" experience. _Militia_ - some sector operations are faster and 
cheaper, this is also the only faction that can train militia (but only once). Mercenaries wear militia related clothes 
from base game. _Rebels_ - Each wave increases BobbyRayShop tier by 2 instead of 1 and the deliveries are twice as fast, 
but the player ears way less money from each wave. Mercenaries wear rebels related clothes from base game.
