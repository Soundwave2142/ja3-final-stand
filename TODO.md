# JA3-FinalStand

## TO FIX:

## TO DO:

#### 0.90
- Better reward system based on loyalty.
- Give some basic supplies on start (ammo, armor, 2-3 guns, depends on enemy faction).
- Harder factions give starting squad XP to level up from the get go, before first wave.
- Add help for custom campaign (~compile the list, write them).
- Militia can only be trained once per wave.
- Add mercs from base game that are not available by default (~add dialogs for them).
- Rework Main Menu injection (technical).
#### 1.00
- Broader Spawn Zones + More Spawn Zones.
- Final Stand wave and description is now also shown in quests.
- Scrapping weapons provides all possible parts + more scrap.
- Training mercs provide more points to the stat, mercs naturally get stats faster.
- Scouting the sector will reveal the enemies for the next wave, scouting takes more time.
- End the game if player has entered Last Chance with not sufficient funds to hire any mercs.
- Rework appearance changer class (better hip/chest attachables offset for females).
- Rework extendability support.
- Prepare guide on extendability.
#### 1.10
- Legion Player Faction, Militia Enemy Faction.
- Fix Translations IDs + Translate to other languages.

## IDEAS:
- Add unique main menu map.
- Mercs wear their cloth in main menu.
- Give a little bit of supplies on turn end (Only for Army?).
- Add rest of Enemy Factions as Playable (Legion, Adonis, Army, Super Soldiers).
- Add support for mercs that are not part of the starting choices.
- Add Boss Enemies for each faction.
- New Faction PMC (M.E.R.C?).
- Add images for faction description in menu.
- Sector Operations improving the Map (Reinforcements, Machine Guns).
- Rework Start and Ending (Cutscenes? Better Credits?)
- Add voice responses to start/surviving waves (different announcer for each faction?)
- Reward the player beyond Final Stand (e.g. in Hot Diamonds)
- Each Player Faction has a slightly different UI (only color/some icons?)
- Multiplayer support

## LORE IDEAS:

FS takes place 2 month before the Game Campaign Start

- FS Commander (player) is hired by an unknown individual with altered voice known as The Handler.
- * This individual is an agent of a foreign (unspecified western) nation.
- The handler will give sitrep on current map, faction and enemy faction.
- * Operations that are unlikely, like Army fighting Army or Legion fighting Militia are posed as false flag operations, this is hinted but not directly conveyed to the player.
- Each time a player beats a specific FS sector (7 waves), and returns to vanilla campaign (HD) handler will contact them and notify about a reward (such as weapon caches with unique guns) in that sector.
- Once player has beaten all available sectors (7 waves completed on each), unique custom-made sector in B2 is available to start in.
- In this sector, once campaign is started, The Handler explains it to the player that his operation has been compromised, and a foreign agency is moving on to eliminate him.

Pre Campaign Story / Constraints:

Adonis sponsored Legion, Spike created Legion for Adonis to control mines.
Spike went rogue and took legion for himself defying the will of Adonis.
Adonis hired MERC to overtake mines back. They failed.
Adonis hired AIM to overtake mines back.

Fauchex is a traitor to the government and elected president trying to sell riches of GC.

Hi, I've though about the map, and it's story.
I think it would be good if unused B1 sector was utilized and judging from the sat picture the map can be combination
of open plain, jungle and sand.

Map itself is like an open hill, I want player to have some high-ground and enemies attacking from different sides will reinforce 'final stand' feeling.

Story that maps tells:
In the middle there's a abandoned building, can be something like a small school. Outside of it signs of abandonment, growth, trash, etc.

## ADDONS IDEAS:

- Cold War themed, CIA vs KGB In Africa. 1-2 custom maps similar to main game.
- Vietnam Inspired. 1 military base map, 1 jungle outpost map.
- Yugoslav Wars Inspired. 1 snow map, 1 forest map, 1 village map.
