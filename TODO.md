# JA3-FinalStand

## TO FIX:

## TO DO:

#### 1.00
- Final Stand wave and description is now also shown in quests.
- Scrapping weapons provides all possible parts + more scrap.
- Training mercs provide more points to the stat, mercs naturally get stats faster.
- Broader Spawn Zones + More Spawn Zones.
- Scouting the sector will reveal the enemies for the next wave, scouting takes more time.
- End the game if player has entered Last Chance with not sufficient funds to hire any mercs.
- Rework appearance changer class (better hip/chest attachables offset for females).
- Rework extendability support.
- Prepare guide on extendability.
#### 1.10
- Give little bit supplies on wave completion.
- Legion Player Faction, Militia Enemy Faction.
- Fix Translations IDs + Translate to other languages.

## IDEAS:
- Add unique main menu map.
- Mercs wear their cloth in main menu.
- Add rest of Enemy Factions as Playable (Legion, Adonis, Army, Super Soldiers).
- Add Boss Enemies for each faction.
- New Faction PMC (M.E.R.C?).
- Add images for faction description in menu.
- Sector Operations improving the Map (Reinforcements, Machine Guns).
- Rework Start and Ending (Cutscenes? Better Credits?)
- Add voice responses to start/surviving waves (different announcer for each faction?)
- Reward the player beyond Final Stand (in Hot Diamonds)
- Each Player Faction has a slightly different UI (only color/some icons?)
- Multiplayer support

## LORE IDEAS:

### FS takes place 2 month BEFORE the Game Campaign Start
###### Pre Campaign Constraints:
Adonis sponsored Legion, Spike created Legion for Adonis to control mines.
Spike went rogue and took legion for himself defying the will of Adonis.
Adonis hired MERC to overtake mines back. They failed.
Adonis hired AIM to overtake mines back.
Fauchex is a traitor to the government and elected president trying to sell riches of GC.

###### Campaign Story:
- FS Commander (player) is hired by an unknown individual with altered voice known as The Handler.
- * This individual is an agent of a foreign (unspecified western) nation.
- The handler will give sitrep on current map, faction and enemy faction.
- * Operations that are unlikely, like Army fighting Army or Legion fighting Militia are posed as false flag operations, this is hinted but not directly conveyed to the player.
- Each time a player beats a specific FS sector (7 waves), and returns to vanilla campaign (HD) handler will contact them and notify about a reward (such as weapon caches with unique guns) in that sector.
- Once player has beaten all available sectors (7 waves completed on each), unique custom-made sector in B2 is available to start in.
- In this sector, once campaign is started, The Handler explains it to the player that his operation has been compromised, and a foreign agency is moving on to eliminate him.
