# JA3-FinalStand

## TO FIX:

## TO DO:

- Description for start update.
- Descriptions for Steam/Git/Mod

## TO IMPLEMENT:

- Better reward system based on reputation + wave.
- Give some basic supplies on start (ammo, armor, 2-3 guns).
- Add help for custom campaign (f1 in-game?)
- End the game if player has entered last chance with not sufficient funds to hire any mercs.
- Rework Main Menu injection.
- Rework appearance changer class.
- Fix Translations IDs + translate to other languages.

## IDEAS:
- Add unique main menu map.
- Mercs wear their cloth in main menu.
- Give loadouts to sector inventory on game start (depending on mers and their types).
- Give a little bit of supplies on turn end (Only for Army?).
- Add rest of Enemy Factions as Playable (Legion, Adonis, Army, Super Soldiers).
- Add support for mercs that are not part of the starting choices.
- Add Boss Enemies for each faction.
- New Faction PMC (M.E.R.C?).
- Add images for faction description in menu.
- Sector Operations improving the Map (Reinforcements, Machine Guns).
- Rework Start and Ending (Cutscenes? Better Credits?)
- Add voice responses to start/surviving waves (different announcer for each faction?)
- Reward the player beyond Final Stand (e.g. in Hot Diamonds)
- Each Player Faction has a slightly different UI (only color/some icons?)
- Multiplayer support

## LORE IDEAS:

- In FS Commander (player) is hired by an unknown entity/organization (for Mercs) or faction representative (for other factions)
- Upon beating FS with certain faction, faction representative will reward the player in HD with unique rewards.
- Money for Mercs, weapon drops for Rebels, cheaper militia training (faster?) for Militia.

## ADDONS IDEAS:

- Cold War themed, CIA vs KGB In Africa. 1-2 custom maps similar to main game.
- Vietnam Inspired. 1 military base map, 1 jungle outpost map.
- Yugoslav Wars Inspired. 1 snow map, 1 forest map, 1 village map.
